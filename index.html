        I hope you have a great and wonderful birtday, I'll be waiting for you
        while you're in JB. I want to take this time to tell you that I
        appreciate everything you've done for me and that you mean a lot to me.
        I will always be here for you, I will be here no matter what we go
        through. I want to grow old with you, I want to be with you for the rest
        of my life. There is no one else I would rather be with than you. You
        are my best friend, my soulmate, my everything. I love you more than
        words can say. Theres more to say but you'll have to read it in person
      </p>
